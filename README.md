# Weather Trends Exploration
 
### Summary:
In this project, I analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the temperature trends for 2 cities - New York in United States (where I currently live) and Pune in India (where I belong to) 
Extracting the data from the database in Udacity workspace 
I  exported the temperature data for the world as well as New York and Pune. I used SQL to extract data from schema.
### Data Visualization:
The chart line compares New York and Pune temperatures with the global temperatures. Now, for better visualization, I used 10 year moving average of temperatures rather than yearly averages. Moving averages smooth out data to make it easier to observe long term trends and not
get lost in daily fluctuations. 
### Observations:
All included in the pdf file, the observations include the similarities and differences between the world averages, New York and Pune averages, as well as overall trends.
